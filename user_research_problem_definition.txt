Problem Description
International students with limited English proficiency face challenges comprehending lectures, participating in discussions, and understanding discipline-specific vocabulary. These barriers reduce academic engagement, increase stress, and negatively affect performance, potentially limiting retention and overall academic success

From Wu (2015), a qualitative study of international students adjusting to college in the U.S.:
“All participants… claimed that their professors were nice, professional, and approachable. However, they noted difficulties in communicating with their professors due to language barriers, cultural differences, and different expectations from professors.”

From Trenkic & Warmington (2018):
In a matched study of Chinese vs. British students, “large and significant group differences were found at entry and eight months later. … Language and literacy indicators explained 51% of variance in the Chinese group's grades… language proficiency appears predictive of academic outcomes only before a certain threshold is reached, and this threshold does not correspond to the minimum language entry requirements.”

From an interpretive phenomenological analysis (Glory Gatwiri, 2015):
Language difficulties surfaced as a central theme affecting psychological wellbeing, linked to “Sense of Loss, Cultural Stress, Language Barriers, Social Support, Emotions, and Physical State.”
