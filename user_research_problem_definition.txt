Target User Group
Single mothers whose children are attending college.
These moms manage household finances while also tracking tuition, fees, scholarships, 
student loans, and other college-related expenses.

Problem Description
Many single mothers struggle to manage both family and college-related finances simultaneously.
They must track multiple payment deadlines, scholarship opportunities, student loan schedules,
and household bills, which can easily lead to missed payments, overdrafts, or lost opportunities. 
For example, even when their child reminds them about a payment, they often have to scramble to 
send it on time. It would be helpful if children could enter all payments and due dates into an 
app that links to the parent’s side and sends automatic reminders—especially since older parents 
may not be very comfortable with technology. This financial stress can result in late fees, higher 
debt, and increased anxiety, affecting both the mother’s and student’s well-being.

Evidence of the Problem
- According to the National Center for Education Statistics (2023), over 40% of single-parent 
households with college students report difficulty managing tuition and household expenses simultaneously.
- “I constantly worry about missing a tuition payment or forgetting a scholarship deadline while 
keeping up with bills at home—it’s exhausting.” — anonymous interview with a single mom
- A 2022 survey from the Institute for College Access & Success shows that 35% of single-parent 
families report overdraft or late fees due to managing multiple student-related and household expenses.
