Demographics

Many are undergraduate and late high school students (≈ ages 16-24) in large-enrollment or lecture-style courses. Studies of college science or large classes show hesitation in asking questions among these populations. Sibia, Bernuy, Williams, Liut, and Petersen (2023) indicate that most students are either inactive or participate invisibly because of threats to students’ identities and low academic confidence.
From the dendograms above, Sibia, Bernuy, Williams, Liut, and Petersen (2023) deduce that the preference for visibility level may be related to confidence in answering questions.

A noticeable portion of students with lower academic self-efficacy—those who doubt their understanding or ability—are more likely to avoid asking for help or questions. 
At the individual level, a student's decision to avoid seeking help was related to the student's sense of academic efficacy and to gender. As expected, students who felt less efficacious regarding their school work were more likely to report avoidance of seeking help when they needed it. (Ryan, Gheen, & Midgley, 1998)

Instructors tend to be those teaching mid to large classes, especially in settings where lecture time is tight and covering content is prioritized over interactive Q&A; also, those interested in improving student engagement or in courses with historically low participation. In fact, Nadile et al. (2021) state that the majority of students in their sample size of 417 undergrads at a research-intensive institution reported that they never ask or answer questions in large-enrollment college science courses during a semester.


Pain Points
Fear of negative evaluation/embarrassment. Students often feel anxious about how classmates will judge them, concerned about appearing “dumb.” This inhibits asking questions in class. Sibia, Bernuy, Williams, Liut, and Petersen (2023)

Time constraints & pace of lectures. Lectures move quickly; instructors may not pause for every confusion. Some students miss clarifications because there isn’t space in the flow of class to address every question deeply. 

Lack of safe/supportive classroom environment. This includes instructor behavior (e.g., how errors or questions are handled), peer norms (competition, comparison), and whether asking questions is tied to grades or visibility. In classrooms where mastery/ \intrinsic goals are emphasized (vs competition), help-seeking is more likely. (Ryan, Gheen, & Midgley, 1998)

Daily Habits

Use of digital forums/online help outside class. Many students lurk or participate more in online Q&A/discussion boards rather than speaking up in class, especially when anonymity or lower visibility is possible. Fear of being judged suppresses visibility. Sibia, Bernuy, Williams, Liut, and Petersen (2023).

High reliance on lecture notes, recordings, and self-study materials. When questions are missed during class, students go back to slides/recordings/textbooks to try to fill in gaps, sometimes forming study groups after class. (Implied in research on student engagement and self-efficacy.) 

Sensitivity to classroom goal structure and teacher-student interaction. Students tend to be more comfortable asking when the instructor uses inclusive strategies, signals openness to questions, or when classroom norms emphasize understanding over performance. Also, students’ beliefs about the classroom environment (e.g. relative ability vs mastery) affect their help-seeking behavior. (Ryan, Gheen, & Midgley, 1998)



Market size & opportunity


Key Data Points (U.S.)

There are about 19.28 million undergraduate college students in the U.S. as of Fall 2024. 
There are about 15 million high school students in the U.S. in recent years. 
WICHE projects U.S. high school graduates will peak around 3.8-3.9 million in 2025, then decline. 


Assumptions for Market Segmentation

To estimate SAM/SOM, need to make some assumptions about what fraction of the population would actually be relevant users:

Let’s assume that 30% of college and high school students feel enough discomfort/hesitation about asking questions that they would likely use our app. (Based on surveys showing a significant proportion self-censoring or intimidated in class; e.g., ~60-64% of students in large enrollment science classes report discomfort with answering questions.)
Assume only some subset of schools/institutions will adopt the tool (say 20-30% initially) because of budget, awareness, and willingness.
SOM will depend on marketing, penetration in early years: maybe 5-10% of the SAM in a realistic early scenario.

Also assume pricing: for simplicity, assume a subscription model or per-seat pricing, say average revenue per user (student + instructor footprint) of US$10/year (this is just a placeholder to convert counts into $-TAM etc.).

Estimated Market Size

Putting it together, here are rough estimates for U.S. only:

Let student + instructor eligible base = high school + undergrad = ~15 million + ~19 million = ~34 million students.

If 30% are potential users → ~10.2 million.

If schools/instructors adopt in 30% of possible contexts → serviceable ~3 million.

If you capture 10% of that in early years → obtainable ~300,000 users.

If each user yields ~$10/year → revenues:

Full potential (TAM): 34 million × $10 = $340 million/year
Serviceable (SAM): 3 million × $10 = $30 million/year
Serviceable obtainable (SOM): 300,000 × $10 = $3 million/year

These are U.S. market estimates. International expansion could multiply these substantially.

Reviews
Slido
• Live Q&A (students submit questions live or in advance) anonymously or with identity; upvoting of questions. 
• Integration with PowerPoint, Google Slides, Zoom, Teams. 
• Moderation tools (pre-approve questions, remove duplicates, label/categorize)
• Analytics / export of question logs. 
Sl
• Very accessible: no login / no downloads often, join via link/code. Good UX. 
• Anonymity helps shy students; upvoting helps prioritize what’s of most interest.
• Fairly mature product, good integrations
• Free plans often limit number of polls/questions or participants. More advanced features are behind paywalls. 
• Less focused on follow-ups after class (detailed explanations, structuring unanswered questions).
• The live Q&A tends to still interrupt flow somewhat if the instructor tries to answer in class; may need to toggle between content and Q&A.
• Some instructors report difficulty managing moderation in large classes in real time.
• Users often say “easy to use,” “intuitive” (especially modest sessions). 
• In G2 comparisons vs Mentimeter, Slido scores a bit higher on reporting/dashboard, event security, and ease of admin. 
• Some frustration in free-tier limits and cost scaling.
