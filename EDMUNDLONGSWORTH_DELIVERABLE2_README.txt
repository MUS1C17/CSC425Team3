Reflection
This exercise highlighted the importance of addressing team conflict respectfully and constructively. 
In Round 1, I observed how the mediator warned one speaker about the consequences of missing standups while providing a fair solution to the other speaker by allowing them to distribute the workload across future sprints. 
In Round 2, when I took the role of a speaker, I experienced the importance of clearly expressing my perspective and reasoning while remaining calm and respectful. 
This way, it is easier for the other team members to reciprocate the same method of communication, which increases the likelihood of conflict resolution. 
Overall, I realized that effective conflict resolution depends on honest and respectful communication and a mediatorâ€™s ability to guide the discussion (optional) so that all parties feel heard and solutions are reached collaboratively.
