User Group Profile
Target users are primarily high school and college students (ages 16–24) who often hesitate to ask questions during lectures due to fear of embarrassment or slowing down the class.
Data Insight: Nuri (2019) found that students often avoid asking questions due to fear of ridicule, fear of appearing “stupid,” or receiving negative responses from teachers.
User Insight: Graesser et al. (1994) highlighted that students remain silent because of social fears of appearing uneducated in front of peers.
Habits: These students are frequent users of laptops and mobile devices, making them well-suited to adopt a digital solution.
Secondary Users: Instructors who need a structured way to capture, prioritize, and answer questions without derailing lectures.
