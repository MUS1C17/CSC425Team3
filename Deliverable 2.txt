Target User Group
College and high school students who hesitate to ask questions during class due to fear of embarrassment, and instructors who need a structured way to capture, prioritize, and answer questions without disrupting lecture flow.

Problem Description
Many students avoid asking questions during lectures because they are worried about “looking dumb” or slowing down the class. At the same time, professors can’t always pause a lecture for lengthy explanations without sacrificing coverage of core material. As a result, students’ misunderstandings linger, overall participation decreases, and valuable clarifications are lost after class.

Evidence of the Problem
“Fears felt by students according to the teacher include fear of being ridiculed by his friends, fear of being considered stupid and fear of getting a poor response from the teacher so that students tend to choose silence even though he does not understand the material being studied.” —

“Another reason that students oftentimes remain silent is due to the fear of appearing uneducated in front of their classroom peers” —

“How Might We” Statement
How might we create a classroom Q&A platform that allows students to ask questions anonymously and in real time, while giving instructors the flexibility to answer live or provide detailed responses after class?
