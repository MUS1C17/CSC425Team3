Target User Group
Recent Minority College Graduates (ages 22–25)
Primarily Black and Hispanic students who completed a four-year degree but face barriers to entering jobs aligned with their education.

Problem Description
Recent minority college graduates often face systemic underemployment, where they end up working in jobs that do not require a degree.
This issue disproportionately impacts young graduates and has long-term effects on career mobility, financial security, and professional identity.
Despite completing higher education, these graduates struggle to transition into meaningful employment, highlighting inequities in the education-to-workforce pipeline.

Evidence of the Problem

Economic Policy Institute. (2010). *Young workers hit hard by the COVID‑19 economy: Workers ages 16–24 face high unemployment and an uncertain future*.

Quote:
“Over these years, overall underemployment averaged 29.4 % for young workers ages 16–24,
twice as high as for workers ages 25 and older (14.2 %).
In both age groups, Black and Hispanic workers experienced far higher underemployment rates than any other demographic.”

Quote:
“More than half of recent four‑year college graduates, 52 percent, are underemployed a year after they graduate,
according to a new report from Strada Institute for the Future of Work and the Burning Glass Institute.
A decade after graduation, 45 percent of them still don’t hold a job that requires a four‑year degree.”

Quote:
“‘Underemployment’ refers to the experience of four‑year college graduates who are employed in jobs that typically do not require a bachelor’s degree.
A recent report states that over 50 % of college students are underemployed within the first year of graduation and many of these graduates stay underemployed 5–10 years after graduation.”


“How Might We” Statement
How might we find a better way to make the transition between college and the job market so that younger people, especially those that fall under minority groups, have an easier time getting a job?
